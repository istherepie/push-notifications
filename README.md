# Push Notifications (DEMO)

Building a notification service using SSE (Server-sent events)...

## TODO

*Prototype nearly done, a bit of housekeeping needed!*

**Frontend**
* [x] Add layout and styling
* [x] Split App class into several components (maintainability)
* [ ] Check connection status loop

**Backend**
* [ ] Change: publish method should accept a more generic []byte interface
* [ ] Add json tagged structs for broadcast messages
* [ ] Send heartbeat event / keepalive
* [ ] Input validation for message requests
