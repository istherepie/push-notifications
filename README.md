* [x] Split App class into several components (maintainability)
* [ ] Check connection status loop
* [ ] Setup testing suite
* [ ] Replace showcase with simple frontend (for readability)

**Backend**
* [x] Send heartbeat event / keepalive
* [ ] Send system events to clients (demo purposes)
* [x] Escape user input
* [x] Simple `running` metrics
* [ ] Make event types configurable
